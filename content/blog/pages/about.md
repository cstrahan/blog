Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Charles Strahan, a Staff+ Software Engineer based in Dallas, TX, USA.

I got my start in software around the age of 12, writing little 2D games (like clones of [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)), [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)), [Missile Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command)), as well as some less honorable reverse engineering (cheating in games by patching executables, manipulating save files, and poking at memory).

I now have 15+ years in professional software development, having helped companies in a multitude of markets both scale up and move faster with strategic innovations in their infrastructure.
